Current Address: http://www.vanneman.umd.edu/districts/index.html (last time I
accessed this URL, sas files were missing). Downloaded data files looks mangled
(they are renamed to .csv file in `original` folder).


Luckily I found a snapshot of these files:
https://web.archive.org/web/20130314062432/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/districts/files/index.html
. Both sas and raw data files are downloaded from here. In `original` folder,
*.data files are ASCII files and *.sas are the sas files.
